      "description": "The first Air Jordan was produced for use by Michael Jordan. They were Designed by Peter B. Moore, and released during his sophomore season with the Chicago Bulls.[7] Along with iconic release of colorways; including Air Jordan 1 Royal. The Jordan 1 Royal is also the only shoe that Jordan never ever wore on the court. The Air Jordan Metallic, Air Jordan Black Toe and more were alternate designs of the shoe. Whereas all other shoes failed to gain popularity, only the Air Jordan 1 Chicago, which managed to gain any prominence. Additionally in 1994, Nike came out with the Air Jordan Chicago Rendition, affixed with the Nike Air tag on the tongue. Meanwhile 2 decades without any change this was considered the best retro. The year 2013, Air Jordan 1 again released with Nike Air branding and lasted for 2 years. Finally in 2015, there was a true Chicago 1 fashion having the Nike Air labeling on tongue and no jumpman silhouette. Once again they are re-imagining Chicago Jordan 1 on 29 October 2022.[9] The red and black colorway of the Nike Air Ship, the prototype for the Jordan I, was later outlawed by then-NBA Commissioner David Stern for having very little white on them. (This rule, known as the \"51 percent\" rule, was repealed in the late 2000s.) "
